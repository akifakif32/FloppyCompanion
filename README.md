# FloppyCompanion

<p align="center"><img src="docs/images/floppycompanion.png" alt="FloppyCompanion" width="720" /></p>

FloppyCompanion is a KernelSU WebUI module for configuring FloppyKernel variants. It exposes kernel feature toggles, device-specific tweaks, and a presets system through a modern Material Design interface.

## Requirements
- Root solution:

        - KernelSU (recommended)

        - Magisk (via KernelSU WebUI compatibility)

        - APatch (untested)
- FloppyKernel installed:

        - Floppy1280: v6.2+ supported
        
        - FloppyTrinketMi: v2.0b+ required

Note: If you spoof the kernel version (SusFS, BRENE), feature detection and patching will break.

## How it works
- Reads current kernel cmdline and sysfs state for feature/tweak status.
- Applies feature toggles by patching the boot image (kernel cmdline or header).
- Applies tweaks via backend scripts that write to sysfs and persist configs.
- Reapplies everything at boot through service scripts.

## Features
- FloppyKernel feature toggles (per device family)
- Common kernel tweaks (ZRAM, VM, I/O scheduler)
- Platform-specific tweak panels (thermal, undervolt, charging, display, GPU)
- Preset save/load/apply system
- Material Design 3 WebUI with i18n support

## Usage
1. Install the module through KernelSU Manager.
2. Open KernelSU Manager and launch the module WebUI.
3. Apply features and tweaks as needed.
4. (Optional) Save your configuration as a preset.

## Build
```bash
cd repo
./build.sh
```
The module zip will be emitted by the build script in the repo directory.

## Notes and troubleshooting
- Boot image patching is sensitive. If flashing fails, restore your stock boot image.
- Some experimental features may be hidden or marked risky in the UI.
- If features don’t show up, confirm the kernel name matches a supported FloppyKernel variant.
